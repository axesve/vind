This is a continous list of things that needs to be fixed, removed or added.<br>
An empty list means that there is no issues, features and bugs to be taken care of. But feel free to report any bugs and or system improvements!

* Add comments to everything!

* Add a installation system
* Add Mac + Linux support
* Add a backend system

* REDO Theme system, add a "theme" array and make it so people can just add a new CSS file instead of having to the current method for adding themes. Then make the system loop thru "themes" at run time and print out new themes in the Themes selector!

---

* [x] Todo should be markdown for easier reading and formatting
* Remove npm from dependencies, totally unnecessary! Keep your depencies small as possible
* Remove jquery.js, you're already loading it as a dependancy
* If this project is going to grow, you should move your app files to src folder, for easier management & to keep your 'root' folder clean as possible
* About page github link should be clickable
* Main window should close if you click anywhere else on your screen, ie. when losing focus -> close(hide) win. Bad user experience if you have to click on the window to focus it and then press space just to close it.
