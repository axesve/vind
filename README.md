# Vind
Electron based software that stores clipboards with **CTRL + B**.<br>

# Features
* Full Text formatting support (newline, spaces etc)
* Multiple tags for different things, if you want one tag for "History" then go ahead. Clicking on the default "General" at the top right will let you choose tags.
* Correct date and time sorting, you can also hide dates if you dont want to show them by pressing the date text at the top left of each date container.
* Themes, you can currently change between 3 themes: ```bright, dark, and stars```
* 

# Prerequisites
Vind is built on Electron, so for you to run the current Vind application you need to have Electron installed

```
npm install electron -g
```

# Installation
Since Vind still is in its development phases there is currently no production installer ready.
You can clone the repo and run it like below:

```
git clone https://github.com/axesve/vind.git
cd ../vind
npm install
npm start
```

# Contributing
This project is open source, would love for people to come help me build it into something even better!<br>
Check the TODO list if there is anything that needs fixing also if you find any features that are missing / could be improved go ahead and just right on it.
