# Prerequisites
Vind is built on Electron, so for you to run the current Vind application you need to have Electron installed

# Contributing
This project is open source, would love for people to come help me build it into something even better!<br>
Check the TODO list if there is anything that needs fixing also if you find any features that are missing / could be improved go ahead and just right on it.
